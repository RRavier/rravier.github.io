## Hello, my name is Robert Ravier.

### I like a lot of things, but most of all, solving problems.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at Duke University under Vahid Tarokh, working in problems related to time-varying optimization.

I received my PhD under the guidance of Ingrid Daubechies, having worked on problems related to biological shape analysis.

In addition to my postdoc appointment in time-varying optimization, I am also an active member in Duke University's Tooth and Claw and Quantifying Gerrymandering groups.
