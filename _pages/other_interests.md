I care a lot about math and science, but I have many interests and thoughts outside of this realm. **Here are some non-math things about me.**

* Felix Kramer is very near and dear to me. He does cool stuff, too, but with art. You should check out his stuff at [Atrocityland.](http://www.atrocityland.com) I really like the Meoms.

* My favorite pieces of media, in no particular order, are Twin Peaks Season 3, Mother 3, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, The Lego Movie, Nixon in China, OutRun, and the theme to Spectre.

* I have been working on a three-part novel since I was twelve, and have outlined the first and last parts but never came close with the middle.

* My favorite musical pieces that I've ever performed (voice) are Beethoven's Ninth and Ginastera's Lamentations

* My favorite wrestling matches are John Cena vs. CM Punk at MITB 2011, The Final Deletion, and Seth Rollins vs. The Fiend at HIAC 2019.
