I've been teaching in some form since I was twelve, when I started tutoring classmates and, on extremely rare occasion, giving lectures when teachers were absent. I have continued in some facet ever since, working in Cornell's Math Support Center (walk-in tutoring for all undergraduate and some graduate courses) while an undergrad myself, acting as a calculus TA/instructor and guest lecturing while a PhD student, and serving as a TA for a large graduate course on applied deep learning as a postdoc, all while continuing to tutor all sorts of classes for private clients. **Education was, is, and will always be an important part of my life regardless of career path; I will be involved off-hours in some capacity even if my primary employer is not directly involved.**

The pages below will cover different important aspects of my thoughts and my experiences, be it my actual thoughts and experiences, as well as notes and other resources that I like/make myself.
