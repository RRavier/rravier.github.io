I am an ***applied mathematician***, but I prefer the term ***computational scientist***.

I was trained as an undergrad by Bob Strichartz at Cornell, and I received my PhD under the guidance of Ingrid Daubechies at Duke.

I currently work with Vahid Tarokh as a postdoc in Duke University's Electrical Engineering department.

My primary motivations concern applied problems, and I spend a lot of time in this end framing my work around **evolutionary biology**, **partisan gerrymandering**, and **problems related to time-varying scenarios**. From a mathematical perspective, I think a lot about

* Data Driven Online Optimization
* Geometry and its Applications in Data Science
* Statistics for Shape Data
* Foundational Language for Mathematical and Scientific Problems

But there's always more ideas brewing, so **let's talk.**
