##A Brief Overview and Recent History of Partisan Gerrymandering

A census is performed in the United States every ten years. Based on the results of the census, each state is allotted some number of representatives for the U.S. House of Representatives. These representatives are tied to geographic subregions of each state known as districts. Each state has different procedures for how districts are drawn provided that every district has as equal as possible population and obeys the Voting Rights Act, which is a condition regarding the number of racial minorities in the districts. Gerrymandering is the act of drawing districts in a way to artificially affect the outcome of elections.

Historically there has been a lot of attention paid to racial gerrymandering, which focused on grouping together and splitting apart minorities as convenient in order to reduce their influence on an election, a practice which has been well established as being illegal. There have been a number of racial gerrymandering court cases that have reached the Supreme Court. Since the case Vieth v. Jubelirer, attention has also turned towards partisan gerrymandering: the act of grouping together and splitting apart political factions in order to reduce their influence on an election.
